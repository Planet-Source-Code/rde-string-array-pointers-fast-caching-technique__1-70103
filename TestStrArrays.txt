String array pointers fast caching technique

This is a simple string pointer caching technique that speeds up the testing of algorithms that manipulate string array pointers such are string sorting routines ... 

I found the most time consuming part of sort testing was the resetting of the test array before every test ... 

This is a solution that removes the need to re-assign strings into a test array before every test is started ... 

This 3kb zip contains two sub-routines named CacheArrayPtrs and ResetArrayPtrs ... 

You call CacheArrayPtrs whenever the array is loaded with new items ... 

You call ResetArrayPtrs before every test and instantly be ready to test the original cached array ... 

Usage code included.
